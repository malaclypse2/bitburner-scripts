# bitburner-scripts

My collection of bitburner scripts. 

I've mostly moved to using this https://github.com/malaclypse2/bitburner-scripts-1 code now, but there's still a fancy status HUD, and my manual interaction tools.

Tagged releases probably work. The main branch may or may not work at any given time. I sometimes make live updates there as I develop, which means I sometimes check in broken code while I'm testing.

Everything expects to live in the /scripts/ directory.

net.js is the command and control system.

net-monitor.js runs some semi-fancy monitors of what the system is doing.

bitlib.js tries to consolidate non-application specific code
