# bitburner-scripts

My collection of bitburner scripts. 

Tagged releases probably work. The main branch may or may not work at any given time. I sometimes make live updates there as I develop, which means I sometimes check in broken code while I'm testing.

Everything expects to live in the /scripts/ directory.

bitlib.js tries to consolidate non-application specific code
net-hack.js runs an automated hacking system

growOnce.js, weakenOnce.js, and hackOnce.js are the attack scripts that are copied out to the attack servers.

More to come, maybe
