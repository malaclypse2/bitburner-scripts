# bitburner-scripts

My collection of bitburner scripts. 

Tagged releases probably work. The main branch may or may not work at any given time. I sometimes make live updates there as I develop, which means I sometimes check in broken code while I'm testing.

Everything expects to live in the /scripts/ directory.

net-hack.js runs an automated hacking system

net-monitor.js runs some semi-fancy monitors of what net-hack is doing.

bitlib.js tries to consolidate non-application specific code

growOnce.js, weakenOnce.js, and hackOnce.js are the attack scripts that are copied out to the attack servers.

More to come, maybe
